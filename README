The main functions for working with queues and stacks that I used are
enqueue / dequeue and push / pop. I implemented stacks and tails so that they
keep only the address of the element, allocation should be done before
function call.

In functions I used the variable r for the result (TRUE / FALSE), usually S / s
for stack, Q / q for queue, P / p for process, M / m for memory.
The "execute" function calls the functions for executing the commands.
The "insertQ" function first adds the element using the cmp function
in the queue (add_to_Q), after each element is extracted and added
with the same function in the new queue.
